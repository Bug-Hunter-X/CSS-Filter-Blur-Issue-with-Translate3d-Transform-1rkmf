# CSS Filter Blur Issue with Translate3d Transform

This repository demonstrates a bug where applying the CSS `filter: blur()` property to an element that also uses `transform: translate3d()` can result in the blur effect being ignored or partially applied. This appears to be browser-specific and may be related to high-DPI displays or GPU acceleration.

## Bug Description

The `bug.css` file contains the CSS code that reproduces the issue.  When the element is translated using `translate3d()`, the blur effect is either not visible or appears faint.  This inconsistent behavior across browsers suggests a potential rendering problem.

## Solution

The `solution.css` file offers several potential workarounds. These include using a different compositing approach or avoiding `translate3d()` for the affected elements where possible.  More testing is needed to determine the root cause and optimal resolution.
